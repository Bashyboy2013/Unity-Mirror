This is a Unity Package that I made, if you want a further explaination on how it works here you go:

You make a cube and resise it to what you want
you make a camera in the middle of the cube
you make the camera the child of the cube
you make a render texture
you make a material
you set the render texture in the albeto texture box thing for the material
you set the material as the material for the cube
you set the render texture as the "target texture" for the camera
Your done
